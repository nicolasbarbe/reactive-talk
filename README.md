# Reactive Systems in Java
This is the content used during the livecoding session of the [presentation](http://nicolasbarbe.com/2017/10/22/presentation-at-baselone-2017-reactive-systems-in-java/) I gave at the [BaselOne 2017](http://baselone.ch/). 

## How to use it
Checkout the master branch to start the exercices.

### Exercice 1 - Build a reactive client
The github/../GitHubClient.java class encapsulates the GitHub API and exposes it as a reactive client. Follow the indications in the comment. To test your implementation, you can use jshell (./runjshell.sh) and call the examples in the answers.repl file which is present in the solution branch.

Don't forget to set your GitHub authorization token in the file imports.repl.

### Exercice 2 - Build a reactive service 
The  reactive-service/../Service.java class exposes a few empty reactive REST endpoints. Follow the indications in the comment to implement them.


The answers are available in the solution branch.
